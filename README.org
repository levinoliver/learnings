* github pages using org mode

create a =README.org= file add the following in it at the start.

#+begin_src 
#+SETUPFILE: https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes/org/theme-readtheorg.setup
#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: index
#+end_src
* then create a *_config.yml* file and add the following content in it.

#+begin_src yaml :tangle "_config.yml" 
remote_theme: pages-themes/cayman@v0.2.0
plugins:
- jekyll-remote-theme # add this line to the plugins list if you already have one
#+end_src

but we have a local theme file i.e 

#+begin_src yaml :tangle "_config.yml"
theme: jekyll-theme-readtheorg
sass:
  sass_dir: .
  style: compressed
#+end_src

to export the tangled source code use the keybind =C-c C-v t= which exports the code blocks to source specific files.

* org file link test
